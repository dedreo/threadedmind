        This site is an archive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It began as a handful of saved conversations with an AI model—interesting exchanges worth keeping.
        Over time, those conversations accumulated into something more deliberate: a record of thinking out loud,
        problem-solving, reflection, and everyday reasoning done alongside a machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than prescribing how AI <em>should</em> be used, the archive shows how one person actually uses it in practice:
        from early experimentation, to mental grounding, to financial planning, to mundane logistics—up to and including
        making sure a newly adopted cat survives its first months at home.

      <p>
        The archive is layered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>prologue</strong> consists of early highlights collected manually via copy/paste, memorable moments copied into a simple
        text file during the first weeks of use, before any formal structure existed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>logs</strong> come later. These are full conversation records taken directly from official archive downloads,
        organized chronologically and published with delay. Some entries are focused and intentional; others are ambient,
        fragmented, or exploratory. Together, they form a continuous record rather than a curated narrative.

        The conversations are real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most specific details like names, locations, and dates—are altered or softened for privacy and respect toward people who appear
        in these exchanges. The intent is fidelity to experience and thought process, not forensic precision.

        There’s no required order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entries can be read straight through, explored by tags, or approached as isolated pieces. Patterns tend to emerge
        by following themes rather than dates. The archive rewards slow reading, but doesn’t demand it.

        It doesn’t argue for a particular way of using AI, and it isn’t meant to persuade. It exists as a record—showing
        what happens when a person thinks alongside a machine over time, and how that interaction gradually changes both
        sides of the exchange.This archive doesn’t assume agency, emotion, or intent on the part of the AI. Large language models 
        don’t “feel,” don’t form relationships, and don’t replace human connection. What’s documented here is the user’s side of 
        the interaction: how a tool is used, leaned on, questioned, and occasionally pushed against. Any meaning or continuity comes 
        from the human engaging with it, not the system itself.
