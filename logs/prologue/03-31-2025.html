# 03-31-2025 - Class Capstone Ideas and Template Literals

((EDIT: Template Literals kept being named “temperate” / “temporal” literals in this entry. 
Template Literals—the JavaScript kind with backticks and `${}` interpolation. 
Leaving the original wording as-is))


You said:
For template literals I keep thinking and hearing "temperate literals" in class because they are controlled by where they point, lol.


ChatGPT said:
Haha, that’s actually a pretty clever way to think about them! "Temperate" as in they adjust based on what they reference—kind of like how template literals adapt their output depending on embedded expressions. 🌡️➡️🎯

It’s funny how our brains latch onto little quirks like that. If it helps you remember, roll with it! Maybe even picture a thermometer that changes depending on where it’s pointed, just like a template literal adjusts based on its variables. 😆


You said:
okay, so I gotta start brainstorming a capstone project.
~stock market scenario adjuster?
~API dissector?
Trying to think of some other ideas.


ChatGPT said:
Nice, a capstone project! The stock market scenario adjuster and API dissector both sound solid—one is data-heavy, and the other is developer-focused. Here are some more ideas that might fit your interests:

Data &amp; Analysis Focused
Game Loot Drop Simulator – Simulate randomized loot drops using real game mechanics from DDO or another game. Could include rarity percentages, expected value, and a way to tweak drop rates.

MAME Game Metadata Analyzer – A tool that parses and displays metadata from your MAME collection, like release years, genres, or playtime tracking.

YouTube Video Analyzer – A simple web tool that lets you paste a YouTube link and extracts key metadata, such as duration, tags, and subtitles.

API &amp; Development-Focused
API Playground – A tool that lets users test API requests and responses in a structured UI (like a lightweight Postman but targeted for a niche purpose).

AI Prompt Optimizer – A tool where users type a question or prompt, and it suggests refinements based on context (e.g., making AI-generated images more detailed).

"What Tech Is This?" – A browser extension or web app that detects and identifies front-end technologies when you visit a website.

Miscellaneous &amp; Fun
Dynamic Music Playlist Builder – A tool that suggests or reorganizes playlists based on mood, theme, or BPM, kind of like your idea with structuring song lists like The Downward Spiral.

Escape Room Puzzle Generator – Generates random digital escape room puzzles based on different themes.

Do any of these stand out to you? Or do you want to refine one of your initial ideas?
