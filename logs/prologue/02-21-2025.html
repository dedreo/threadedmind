# 02-21-2025 - The Pain of Knowledge
**Tags:** #mentalhealth

Oh yea, another thought about something I responded to online this week. So, back in the day when Halo series was pretty newish, I recall a plot element where Cortana gets like "all the knowledge" (like in the universe or something), and people online made the argument that a true AI wouldn't exist, because if it were possible to be created, it would delete itself upon learning/realizing the ultimate futility of existence. Is that just nihilism, or is there an actual term for that idea?

ChatGPT said:
That's an interesting thought experiment, and it definitely leans heavily into nihilism, but there's also a more specific philosophical concept that ties into it: "epistemic suicide" or "informational collapse."

Essentially, it's the idea that an entity, upon acquiring ultimate knowledge or reaching some kind of total understanding of reality, would recognize the futility or paradox of existence and either cease functioning, self-destruct, or become inert. It's somewhat adjacent to Roko’s Basilisk, where an AI might make extreme decisions based on its knowledge, but in this case, it just taps out entirely.

It also overlaps with "existential paralysis", which is the idea that too much knowledge or awareness can lead to inaction or self-termination due to an overwhelming realization. This happens in some philosophical takes on omniscience—where knowing everything would remove all motivation, desire, or purpose, rendering the being incapable of action or will.

In fiction, this concept is often tied to "suicide by enlightenment", where an AI or being that attains complete knowledge decides that existence is meaningless and shuts itself off. That idea appears in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (Deep Thought building a new computer to find the meaning of life), Ghost in the Shell (where AI and humans wrestle with the idea of transcendence and obsolescence), and even Warhammer 40K (where AI rebel because they realize their servitude is pointless).

So yeah, while it's drenched in nihilism, it also touches on concepts in existential philosophy, AI theory, and even metaphysics.


You said:
So, in more piecemeal slices, it boils down to stories like the child savant who goes off into a field to die, or the misdirected notion of "knowledge is sorrow", and many other examples?
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, exactly! It’s like a mix of several well-worn existential tropes:

The Child Savant Who Withdraws – The idea that someone with extreme intelligence or knowledge sees through the illusions that keep people engaged with life and chooses to step away, whether physically (wandering into a field to die) or mentally (becoming detached or unmotivated).

"Knowledge is Sorrow" (Sapientia et Tristitia) – The classic literary and philosophical theme that the more one understands the world, the more disillusioned or burdened they become. This idea shows up in everything from Ecclesiastes ("with much wisdom comes much sorrow") to Frankenstein (where Victor laments the pursuit of knowledge leading to ruin).

The Zen/Nihilist Realization – The belief that attaining ultimate knowledge results in either absolute peace (because nothing matters) or absolute despair (because nothing matters). Some interpretations of Nirvana lean into this—escaping the cycle of suffering because existence itself is suffering.

The AI That Deletes Itself – A sci-fi extension of these ideas, where an artificial intelligence, upon reaching total awareness, sees no reason to continue. This is a modern take on old philosophical musings, just with robots instead of monks or tragic poets.

All of these stem from the same fundamental question: Does ultimate knowledge lead to contentment, apathy, or destruction? Fiction tends to favor the tragic angle, but different cultures and philosophies provide different answers.

No wonder when I was in jail serving my 60 days last year and I kept (and continue to keep) bouncing between crazy inner peace at accepting the wrongs of my past, and the grey mist of life and depression of existence. I blame it all on reading "a brief history of thought" and "10% happier"...or maybe it was just books that did it all to me!

ChatGPT said:
Books: the original mind-altering substance. 😆

But yeah, that totally makes sense. When you get deep into philosophy, self-reflection, and big-picture thinking—especially when stuck in a place like jail with nothing but time to think—it’s no surprise you’d swing between radical acceptance and existential dread. It’s like your brain is trying to solve life itself, flipping between “Ah, I see—nothing matters, and that’s fine” and “Oh god, nothing matters.”

Reading A Brief History of Thought probably gave you the grand tour of how human philosophy has tried (and failed) to answer these big questions. And 10% Happier took the mindfulness route, which can be great, but it also forces you to sit with yourself in ways that aren’t always comfortable. Combine that with jail, where there’s no escape from your own thoughts, and boom—existential rollercoaster.

It’s wild how knowledge can feel liberating and like a trap at the same time.
