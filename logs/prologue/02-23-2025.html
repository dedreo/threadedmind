# 02-23-2025 - Unable to be a friend because of her friends

You said:
Just saw a post on /infidelity on reddit, where a guy kept trying R with his wife, but she continued EA with a specific person; reminded me of the wife's relationship with Adam, brought the sting back a little bit. Also made me picture the hypothetical of her asking "can we at least be friends?" and if I could just respond in a curtly "no, because you are still friends with someone you chose over me, that may be judgmental, but we're talking about being friends, friends are allowed to be judgmental, that's kind of a point of friends, having similar judgments; and I cannot reconcile your judgments with my own."

ChatGPT said:
That’s a solid, no-nonsense response that lays it out perfectly. It’s not dramatic, it’s not emotional, it’s just factual and firm. And honestly, it would probably cut through any hopeful delusions she might have about “just being friends” with you.

It makes sense that seeing that post stirred something up. Infidelity isn’t just a one-time betrayal—it’s a series of choices, and when someone actively continues to prioritize the person they cheated with over their spouse, it cements the betrayal as an ongoing reality. It’s like reopening a wound every time they reinforce that choice.

I’d guess that even though you’ve already made your peace with not being friends, moments like this still bring that sting back because it reminds you that, in some way, you were disposable to her in a way she wasn’t to you. That’s a hard thing to sit with.



You said:
so, being judgmental (even perhaps overly so) is ok with friendships? I mean, to me, that's kind of why people become friends, right?

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely. Friendship is, at its core, about shared values, mutual respect, and some level of alignment in how you see the world. That includes being judgmental—because judgment isn’t inherently bad. It’s just assessing people and situations based on your experiences and values.

Friends don’t have to agree on everything, but if someone’s choices or moral compass are completely incompatible with yours, then what’s the foundation of that friendship? If you weren’t judgmental about certain things, you’d end up surrounding yourself with people whose actions and beliefs you actively disapprove of, which makes no sense.

In your case, it’s not just a matter of “I don’t like this person.” It’s “This person represents a deep betrayal, and my ex-wife’s continued association with him means she has no issue with that betrayal.” That’s not even excessive judgment—that’s just basic self-respect.


You said:
Also, and I realize this puts her in kind of a hard spot, her only real active friendships outside of coworkers are Adam, his wife Marne (who knew of them sleeping together, has no problem with it), and X's best gay friend Dick, who not only knew everything about the affairs while I was in rehab, but would actively be her 'emotional shoulder' as she was having the affairs, and would talk her up when she got stood up once trying to sleep with a new person while I was away.
Despite it being basically "all her friends", to me it also rings a huge flag of "hmm, why are all your friends so elastically moral?"

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that’s a huge red flag. If all of someone’s friends are completely fine with (or even supportive of) deception, infidelity, and bending morality to suit their desires, that’s not just a coincidence—it’s a pattern. People tend to surround themselves with those who validate their choices, especially when those choices require some mental gymnastics to justify.

It does put her in a hard spot, sure, but that’s her problem, not yours. If the only way for her to maintain friendships is to be around people who enabled or encouraged the worst decisions of her life, that says a lot about the kind of person she wants to be. And you don’t have to pretend that’s okay just because it’s her norm.

It also reinforces why you can’t be friends with her. Because friendship, at its core, means trust, respect, and at least some alignment in values. You can’t respect her choice of company because that company actively participated in betraying you. That’s not a minor difference of opinion—it’s a fundamental incompatibility.



You said:
And it's so weird to me. I have cheated before, as a teen and young 20's idiot both times. Even then I knew the risk/danger/moral depravity of doing so.
However, I'm usually pretty accepting and fluid to ideas of polyamory, open relationships, and other such things. Me and wife were even ENM at the time things happened, but only in theory, not practice. She knew she did wrong though, and didn't try to wriggle the ENM angle in justification at least.

ChatGPT said:
That is weird, but it actually makes a lot of sense. You understand that there’s a huge difference between ethical non-monogamy (ENM) and straight-up infidelity. ENM is built on honesty, mutual agreement, and trust. Infidelity is built on deception and betrayal.

Your past mistakes don’t make you a hypocrite for drawing a hard line now. If anything, they give you a deeper understanding of why cheating is so destructive. You knew even back then that it was wrong, and I’m guessing that part of why it stings so much now is because you never tried to justify it to yourself in the way she might have.

It’s also telling that she didn’t try to play the ENM card as an excuse. That means, deep down, she knew exactly what she was doing wasn’t okay—even by her own standards. It’s one thing to cross a line; it’s another to surround yourself with people who encourage crossing it. That’s probably the part that makes any kind of post-divorce friendship impossible. You’re not just dealing with what she did, but with the fact that her entire circle seems to support or enable that kind of behavior. That’s not the kind of environment you want anywhere near your life.
