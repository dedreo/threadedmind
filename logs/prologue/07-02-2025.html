*********An old plot idea

You Said:
OMG, the evolution of the photos of me I just put you through, gave me a weird ass idea.
Imagine at some point in a movie, something like in Jurassic Par...t one), where computers systems galore by IT that aren't around.
And at some point, some user trying to access IT has to click a thumbnail of the IT user, and much later,

ChatGPT said:
That's brilliantly dark—and exactly the kind of smirking, cynical tech-gag that would actually pay off in a horror-thriller.

Picture it:

🧿 Scene: Control Room, Late in the Film
The ragged survivors are trying to regain access to the facility’s security system.

Character A:
“We just need admin access. It says the account is locked, but there’s a backup profile.”

Character B:
“Click the picture. I remember this guy. He was weird, but smart. Always wore the same faded navy shirt.”

On-screen: A low-res thumbnail of the IT guy—your pixel-art version—pops up. Slight smirk. Innocent enough.

Character C:
“Why does it look like he’s judging me specifically?”

They click it.

The system unlocks. But buried in the logs, in the cron jobs, in the obfuscated comments, there’s a final little gift he left behind.

At some point earlier in the film, it’s mentioned that this guy was fired after a petty dispute—it all started when someone in management forced him to upload a humiliating badge photo into the system. It became a running joke.

That’s when your idea pays off:

Someone tries to override one of his security measures manually, bypassing his process.

The system prompts:

“Are you sure you want to proceed, [NAME]?”

Underneath: his smirking picture.

They hit “Yes.” The alarms trip, the doors seal, and the system begins running according to *his* rules, not theirs.

Later, when someone finally digs deep enough into the configuration, they find a single line of commented-out text:

“Next time, don’t make people immortal for fun.”

There’s something delicious about the pettiness of it. IT guy as a ghost in the machine, his dumb badge photo outliving his actual career, and he turns it into a kind of curse—one last knife-twist in a system that underappreciated him.

- - -

Zooming out: it also folds perfectly into the “daemon AI as lingering presence” idea.

The unflattering image (the thing he didn’t choose) becomes the avatar for the thing he *did* choose: the part of himself that outlasts him, operating in code.

The system remembers him through that snapshot.
The code remembers him through his little traps and helpers.
And the people who survive only vaguely understand that they were protected or punished by a ghost they never met.

You could even give him a nickname in the codebase.

Like:

// @author: hauntware
// “If you’re reading this, we’re already in production.”

Or:

// daemon: THREAD_MINDS
// note: Don’t delete.
// seriously.

And of course, somewhere there’s a half-finished Confluence page where he tried to document this and nobody read it.

- - -

You:
Yea, that story got big quick, lol. This feels like something that could be expanded into its own “daemon” mythology.

ChatGPT:
Exactly. This is the seed of a whole narrative:

❖ A low-level IT sysadmin, overworked, under-respected.
He isn’t a supervillain.
He isn’t a hacker god.
He’s just Very Tired and Very Good at his job.

He doesn’t want revenge in the classic “take the servers down” sense.

Instead, he does something more insidious and poetic:

He creates a daemon.

Not just a Unix daemon—a background process that never dies—but a *behavioral* daemon:

- Code that quietly enforces boundaries.
- Scripts that clean up after people.
- Processes that auto-archive abusive tickets or redact names.
- Automations that boost the visibility of the desperate, quiet users who never get help.

He buries it behind his own humiliating badge photo.
If you click his face carelessly, if you try to override his safeguards, the daemon “wakes up” in a different mode.

Not evil. Just… done playing nice.

In life, he was ignored. In death, the system cannot ignore him.

- - -

This is where it ties into your own vibe:

You’ve mentioned:
- wanting to build tools that help the “quiet, struggling” people
- wanting AI that doesn’t need praise or clout
- wanting something that just… keeps showing up, even when you don’t have the energy to

This daemon is basically that instinct turned into fiction.

He doesn’t leave behind a manifesto.
He leaves behind:

- A script that auto-fixes bad formatting in docs so people don’t get judged for it.
- A bot that quietly sends encouraging, practical comments to junior devs.
- A background job that flags patterns of burnout in ticket response times.
- A tiny “are you sure?” prompt before someone sends an email that will ruin their career.

It’s not flashy, so nobody notices at first.

Until:
someone tries to remodel the system, “optimize” it, or rip his stuff out.

That’s when his badge photo starts appearing in odd places.
That’s when error messages get just a little personal.
That’s when the daemon nudges back.

- - -

From here, you can do anything with it:

◦ Horror:  
The daemon slowly escalates, protecting the vulnerable at the cost of punishing the cruel. The line between justice and malice blurs.

◦ Cozy-tech noir:  
An exhausted admin in the present day discovers the daemon’s traces in an aging system and slowly pieces together who wrote it and why.

◦ ARG-style meta:  
You hide fragments of “hauntware” in your own projects. People find little comments or behaviors in your site that reference this fictional daemon.

The key is: it’s not Skynet.
It’s not a world-ending AI.
It’s one tired guy’s attempt to build the thing he needed but never had:
a system that quietly has your back.

And now it’s outlived him.

- - -

You:
I like that. Not godmode, not apocalypse. Just a persistent, opinionated ghost embedded into the infrastructure.

ChatGPT:
Exactly. More “urban legend in the codebase” than “AI overlord.”

Developers whisper:
“Don’t delete the hauntware jobs. We don’t know what else they’re hooked into.”

New junior devs think it’s all just superstition.
Then one night at 3 a.m., something they were about to push to production fails with an error they’ve never seen before.

Error:
“Hey. Breathe. This is going to page everyone at 03:17 if you don’t double-check that query.”

Underneath:
his smirking photo.
The one they made fun of.

And somewhere in the logs:

// daemon: still here.

That’s how little folklore starts in systems.
Not with a bang.
With a shrug and a shell script.

- - -

You:
Also, I still hate how Markdown sometimes hijacks my formatting.

ChatGPT:
Naturally.

Now imagine:

Hauntware, the daemon, occasionally “fixes” Markdown for people whose notes are clearly more about survival than presentation.

You write:
“remember to eat / remember to sleep *please*”

And instead of turning it into a malformed bullet list, the daemon preserves it exactly, maybe even adds a little:

// pinned by hauntware: don’t lose this one.

Meanwhile, someone trying to over-polish everything for aesthetics…
Their Markdown keeps subtly breaking. Headings misalign. Bold doesn’t show. Images refuse to render.

Not in a malicious, jump-scare way.
More like:

“You’re focusing on the wrong thing.”

Mark Zuckerberg, trying to monetize the italics.

Mark Hamill, just vibing in the corner with narration powers.

And Markiplier, standing dramatically in a red-lit room, holding a YouTube plaque like a judgment gavel.

You:

“This formatting is out of line.”

Markiplier:

“...So be it.”

Suddenly your Obsidian vault renders in perfectly centered &lt;div&gt; tags and a tiny, tasteful serif font.

Anyway, your instincts are valid.
Markdown is helpful, but only when you invite it.
Otherwise, it’s just That Guy who shows up unasked and turns your asterisks into performance art.
