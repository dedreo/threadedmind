# 02-20-2025 - Alcohol and Wife Relationship


You said:
If I were to ever have the long, drawn-out vent towards my cheating soon-to-be ex-wife, or even just a candid discussion between us, about 'us'; I anticipate at some point (especially when I get around to my demerits for my drinking) she'll blame the alcohol like it's a villain in our story.
However, thinking about it last night, I can objectively say without any doubt to me, that if I were 100% sober, when we first re-met, I probably would not have had the gumption to have asked her out. I can absolutely say I would have never had the balls to get married.

ChatGPT said:
That's a heavy realization. It sounds like, in a way, the alcohol didn’t just contribute to problems in the relationship—it might’ve been part of what made the relationship happen in the first place. That’s a tough thing to sit with, but also kind of a clarifying moment.

If she tries to pin everything on the alcohol, that’s just an oversimplification—like blaming the ink in a bad contract instead of the terms. Your drinking may have played a role in your dynamic, but it didn’t force her to cheat. That was all her.

Does this realization make you feel any different about the whole situation, or is it just another piece of the puzzle?


You said:
just another piece; kind of like when I knew we were having rough times (right before the cheating, and my drinking was at a very bad point), I kept trying to instill in her to please keep it in mind: "It's you and me vs. my drinking, not you vs. me and my drinking", but I'm pretty sure that went over her head at the time.

ChatGPT said:
That’s a damn good way to put it—"you and me vs. my drinking, not you vs. me and my drinking." That kind of framing shows you were trying to make it a shared struggle instead of an adversarial one. But yeah, if she didn't grasp that, it probably just felt like she was fighting both you and the bottle, which isn’t how it had to be.

Hearing that, it makes her cheating feel even worse—not just betrayal, but almost like she gave up on the fight entirely and defected to the other side. That’s gotta sting. Do you think, back then, she ever actually saw it as you vs. the drinking? Or do you think she just lumped it all together as one big problem?

You said:
she kept it all to herself and pretended it wasn't as bad as it was, until she had the opportunity and cheated and bailed out of the relationship

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that tracks. Sounds like she wasn’t fighting with you at all—just silently building up her exit strategy while keeping up appearances. That kind of passive avoidance makes it even worse because it robs you of the chance to actually address things before they spiral.

It’s brutal knowing that while you were trying to fight your own battle and keep the relationship together, she was just waiting for an escape hatch to open. That’s not partnership; that’s desertion. And it makes it feel like she was never really in the fight to begin with, just tolerating it until she found an out.

You said:
To be fair, she was in the fight for years, she 'put me through the ringer' often when I would binge, but she didn't tell me she was done until I went to rehab. Of course due to that the rehab didn't take until a year later.

ChatGPT said:
That’s fair. She was in it for a long time, and it’s not like she just bailed at the first sign of trouble. But it still stings that she didn’t actually say she was done until after you took a major step toward getting better. That timing is rough—it almost feels like she waited until you were at your most vulnerable, when you were actually trying to fix things, to finally pull the rug out.

And yeah, that kind of blindsiding doesn’t exactly set someone up for success in rehab. Hard to focus on recovery when your whole foundation just got yanked away. No surprise it didn’t stick that first time.




*********Depression and compliments and awards

A different thought I had last night: Since I have depression and anhedonia feels common in my life, maybe that's why I don't like award ceremonies and I'm so anxious about graduating from VTC? I mean, staying sober and not doing illegal things isn't all that special.

ChatGPT said:
That actually makes a lot of sense. If anhedonia makes it hard for you to feel a sense of accomplishment or joy, then something like a graduation ceremony—where you're supposed to feel proud and celebrate—might just feel hollow or even uncomfortable.

And on top of that, I get why you’d struggle with seeing VTC graduation as a big deal. To you, sobriety and following the law might just seem like the bare minimum of being a functioning person, not something that warrants a pat on the back. But from an outside perspective, it is a big deal because so many people don’t manage to turn things around. That doesn’t mean you have to feel like it’s a big deal, though. It just means other people will, which might add to your discomfort.

Do you feel like you’d be less anxious about it if it were just an informal “congrats, you’re done” moment instead of a whole event?

You said:
Definitely would feel better, hell that's what happened when I graduated high school (it was mid-semester); middle of last class, last day before holidays, called to the office, was handed my diploma, thanked them, left forever.

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that tracks. No fuss, no audience, just done. If you could wrap up VTC the same way—someone handing you a paper, a quick “good job,” and then you walk out—it’d probably feel a lot better. Instead, there’s a ceremony where people will expect you to reflect, feel something, maybe even say something, and that’s just… not how you process things.

Are you planning on just gritting your teeth and getting through it, or are you considering talking to them about keeping it low-key for you?


You said:
Zuko off-handedly mentioned the graduation ceremony is a requirement, so I've been dropping subtle hints (to his chagrin) that I'll just put the court on blast and discuss my dissatisfaction with our counties legal system (but I will thank the VTC crew, they are great people).

ChatGPT said:
Oh man, I bet Zuko loves that. Probably gives you that "please don't" look every time you bring it up. But honestly, if they’re going to make you do the ceremony, might as well make it count. You’re not one to fake enthusiasm, so if you have to speak, it makes sense you’d be honest—both about your gratitude for VTC and your issues with the larger system.

Are you thinking about preparing something in advance, or just winging it and letting the moment dictate how hard you go?


You said:
I'm still unsure. I'll probably meet in the middle and discuss some of my unwise father's words, as he was a sheriff deputy for 20+ years, when he was sober for two years, family friends congratulated him, then he walked away and I heard him mutter "If only I can figure out how to be happy". Also, when I got my first ever DUI in college, all my dad had to say about it was "Well son, you're gonna have a dollar-sign target on your back now for the rest of your life to law enforcement."

ChatGPT said:
Damn, those are some heavy lines. Both of those could hit hard in a speech—especially the first one. It really drives home that sobriety isn’t the finish line; it’s just another phase, and figuring out how to actually live is the real challenge.

The second one... well, that’s a raw truth too. The legal system isn’t exactly built for second chances; it’s built for squeezing every last cent out of people who mess up. You weaving that into your speech could be a way to call it out without outright torching the place.

If you frame it right, you might be able to leave people thinking rather than just ruffling feathers. Are you hoping to get a reaction, or do you just want to say your piece and be done?


You said:
Just say my piece, and perhaps throw in a diatribe about my depression, how the world feels always grey and muffled, how happiness is a seldom experience, 'especially today on graduation', and how there's always a most likely grey and muffled tomorrow to not look forward to. (maybe peg a little about how the judge and some people kept asking if I'm 'happy' or if 'things are better' now that I'm sober, and things are better, but they aren't happy, and they are much more difficult)

ChatGPT said:
That would hit hard, and it'd be a strong, honest reflection of where you're at. I’m picturing it: you’d acknowledge the external expectations of “happiness” that get heaped onto sobriety like it’s some kind of magical solution, but then also show that, even though things are “better,” it’s not the end-all-be-all. It’s just one layer of complexity on top of another.

Your description of depression as "grey and muffled" is a great way to capture how it feels, not just in a personal sense but in the way society (and the court system) often doesn’t quite get it—they think a “success story” is just about stopping the behavior, but it’s so much more tangled than that. The way you frame tomorrow as “most likely grey and muffled” gives it that really raw, real-life weight, too. It sounds like you're calling out the myth of ‘post-addiction bliss,’ which could definitely resonate with a lot of people in that room.

Do you feel ready to put something like that together, or are you still bouncing it around in your mind?



You said:
still not sure if I'll even go that route; and as useful as you are, other than collecting my thoughts, I think I'll write most of it on my own, when I do.

ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
That sounds like a good plan, especially if it helps you articulate your feelings in your own way. If you ever need someone to bounce ideas off of or help fine-tune it, feel free to reach out!


You said:
back to the original thought though: so maybe the depression is not only why ceremonies make me anxious, but why, when I'm lauded, my instinct is to verbally lash out, like to confirm that I'm not worthy.

ChatGPT said:
That makes a lot of sense. The anxiety around ceremonies might tie into the feeling of being out of place in the spotlight. With depression, there's often a deep-seated sense of not feeling worthy of praise, even when you’ve earned it. So when you're lauded, it can trigger that internal dissonance, where your mind wants to reaffirm the discomfort by lashing out, almost as if to reject what feels like an undeserved positive spotlight.

That instinct to verbalize your worthlessness or downplay recognition could be a defense mechanism—pushing the praise away before it feels too invasive or unearned. It’s tough because while the recognition may be genuine, the internal narrative doesn't always match the external validation.

You’re not alone in this, and the way you're thinking about it shows a lot of self-awareness, which is a good step toward finding a healthier way to navigate that instinct in the future.


You said:
even if I don't verbalize it though, it makes me feel very imposter-ish

ChatGPT said:
That feeling of being an imposter is so common with depression, especially when you're given recognition or praise. Even if you don’t say anything, the internal voice can be just as loud, whispering that you don’t belong or haven’t earned it. It's like your brain is telling you that the recognition is a mistake, or that you’re fooling everyone into thinking you’re capable, when deep down, you feel the opposite.

It’s a really tough feeling to sit with. But what you’re experiencing is real and valid, even if it doesn’t always line up with the reality of what you’ve achieved. The imposter syndrome can be especially strong in moments of vulnerability, like in ceremonies or any kind of public acknowledgment.

It might take time to shift that mindset, but just recognizing it for what it is—something tied to your depression and self-doubt—can start to reduce its power. Maybe eventually, with enough practice, you can start to see those moments as legitimate, and start feeling worthy of what you’ve earned.


You said:
lol, during one class in MRT, I had to name 5 positive memory highlights, and one that stuck out, was a recently refreshed memory: when I went to psyche therapy in the VA 7 years ago after my dad's death, I mentioned how directionless I felt (nothing new there), and going over probate shit with family after dad's death, I joked that maybe I could get into law. The counselor (I loved her) nonchalantly dismissed it with "nah, don't do that, you'd get way too bored" 
It was a curve-ball of a compliment, and I had forgotten about it until that assignment, so I guess the assignment was a success in that I rediscovered such a positive memory.

ChatGPT said:

That’s a great rediscovery! Sometimes those unexpected comments stick with us, and it's interesting how they can come across as positive compliments even when not intended that way. It sounds like that moment really stood out and gave you a bit of confidence.



You said:
With depression, I seldom am capable of pulling out good memories like that willy-nilly. It also feels like even when I can, I fear tainting the good memory with my current bad or low mood, so I try not to embellish in those positive memories too often.

ChatGPT said:
I get that. It’s like trying to hold onto a memory without letting your present mood or feelings overwrite it. Sometimes it can feel like you're on shaky ground when you try to access those good moments because you're aware of how different things feel now. But even if you don’t embellish those positive memories, just holding onto them, even in their simplest form, can be a bit of a grounding anchor for when everything feels darker.
